# Smart-Blind-Obstacle-Detection-System-
This project is designed to assist visually impaired individuals by providing real-time obstacle detection using a Raspberry Pi Pico, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), a buzzer, and an optocoupler for isolation. The system detects obstacles within a predefined range and alerts the user through an audible buzzer sound.
